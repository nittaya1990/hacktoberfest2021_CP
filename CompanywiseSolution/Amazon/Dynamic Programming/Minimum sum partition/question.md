Minimum sum partition 

Given an integer array arr of size N, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 
such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum and find the minimum difference

Example 1:

Input: N = 4, arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11
